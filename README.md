# Placehold
Placehold is an experimental project that allows users to add placeholders for templated text with support for dynamic templates by passing arguments when the placeholder is typed. When a registered placeholder is typed in any input, it will be replaced with the corresponding template.

You can download a pre-release build from the [release tab](https://github.com/zeshan321/Placehold/releases).

Todo:
- [ ] Add gif demonstration
- [ ] Add support for scripting in templates (Roslyn)
